# Local Environment Setup

If you haven't set up Bun, Node, or pnpm yet, you can use [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for convenience.

### Quick References:
- [Install Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)
- [Install Bun](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/bun.html)
- [Set up Node](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/node.html)

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```sh
bun install
```

## Database Setup

### 1. Configure Your Database
If you already have a PostgreSQL database, update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your database URL.

For reference, you can use the provided `env.example` file:
```sh
cp env.example .env
```
Modify it as needed.

### 2. Set Up a Local Database with Docker
If you donâ€™t have a database, you can set up one locally using Docker:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
This will use the `.env` file variables to set up a PostgreSQL database along with a pgAdmin instance.
Make sure to run this from the server folder which has docker-compose.yml file.

### 3. Connect to Your Database with pgAdmin
Use the following credentials to connect to the database via pgAdmin:
```sh
DB_USER=postgres      
DB_PASS=password      
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432        
DB_NAME=satori
```
Ensure these values match the ones in your `.env` file.

## Set Up Database Tables

Run the following commands to configure the database:

```

### Create a New Migration (if needed)
```sh
npx dbmate new <migration-name>
```

### Generate Types for Kysely
```sh
npx kysely-codegen --out-file ./src/types.ts
```

## Start the Application
Run the app with:
```sh
bun run dev
```
## Local Development Email Sending setup
Replace the 
`GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_PASS` with your email and password in the `.env` file. Please go through the following links to understand how to use nodemailer with gmail.

## Delete database and start from scratch
```sh
docker-compose down -v
```
Then start from the database parts again.
